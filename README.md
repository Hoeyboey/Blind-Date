# Blind-Date

Occassionally I use Twine to create short stories, this one being one that takes place over an hour in real time. 

Because it's written in Twine, the code in the HTML file is an utter mess. I wouldn't recommend looking at it, to be honest. In Twine itself, it's great, because it uses many of the built-in macros. 

This was actually a nightmare to code because Twine didn't enjoy it when I started using JavaScript, and the macros functioned better and without errors. The issue, however, was that it's very jammy in how it uses this, causing a host of bugs and things. For example, if you started the game at 11:59pm, it would have to work out how to jump to 00:59 when working out the end time. Add in the general unreadibility of Twine's code, and you've got a mess.

But, I think it's fun. The game is currently being hosted on itch.io at [this link](https://hoeyboey.itch.io/date-night) if you want to play it.
